# About Me

G'day and welcome to my personal blog! Here you can expect to find content about various topics of hacking/red teaming in general, such as CTF machines writeups, HTB ProLabs Reviews, study/preparation tips and many more.  
I have 5 years of experience in the field of cybersecurity, specifically in conducting penetration testing on web apps and infrastructure, OSINT, cracking, and programming. I have also helped mitigate multiple web vulnerabilities for various companies through bug bounty programs, including notable ones like *Rockstar Games*, *Motorola*, *PayPal*, and *Wise*.
